🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game (Python)

A fun mini-project designed to sharpen Python fundamentals such as input handling, conditional logic, dictionary mapping, randomness, and reusable code functions.
Built for practicing logical thinking — an essential skill for every Data Analyst!

📌 Game Overview

This game is a Python implementation of a popular hand game — Snake 🐍, Water 💧, and Gun 🔫.

Snake drinks water
Water drowns gun
Gun kills snake
Each round, the computer makes a random choice, and the user inputs theirs. The game logic determines the winner based on rules and returns the result.
